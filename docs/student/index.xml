Each exercise has an Advanced section that’s meant to give students ideas of other things to try if they blast right through the exercise. In most cases, it’s for students who already knew some Perl before signing up for this class.
Exercise 1 – Hello World Exercise 2 – Math / Formatting Output Exercise 3 – Scalars / Getting Input from Users Exercise 4 – Arrays Exercise 5 – More Arrays Exercise 6 – Associative Arrays (Hashes) Exercise 7 – Conditional Statements Exercise 8 – Loops Exercise 9 – File I/O Exercise 10 – Regular Expressions / Pattern Matching Exercise 11 – Final Exercise</description></item><item><title>Extra Exercises</title><link>https://rahji.github.io/perlcourse/docs/student/extraexercises/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rahji.github.io/perlcourse/docs/student/extraexercises/</guid><description>If students are really moving along, the extra exercises (42K PDF) have some ideas for more elaborate and practical scripts. Some students continued on with these exercises after the whole workshop ended.
Some of the knowledge required to actually complete these advanced exercises is slightly outside the scope of what’s covered in the rest of the class, but they’re still realistic for a beginner.
