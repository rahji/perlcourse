That title is a little deceptive since you really didn’t need any programming experience at all to take the class and learn Perl, but that’s the title they had from a previous on-line Perl course that they offered, so we used it. I also taught a course called “Perl Programming” at Brookline Adult &amp;amp; Community Education in 2001.</description></item><item><title>Instructor Roadmap</title><link>https://rahji.github.io/perlcourse/docs/instructor/roadmap/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rahji.github.io/perlcourse/docs/instructor/roadmap/</guid><description>Download the Instructor Roadmap as a Word document. I hate to put a Word document here, but you really need to see it in Outline view. This is Word 6.0/95 format, so it should be fairly easy to open on most computers. Anyway, this is the document that I wrote to guide myself through each day of class. In Word, make sure you choose the “Outline” view.</description></item><item><title>My Original Notes</title><link>https://rahji.github.io/perlcourse/docs/instructor/notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rahji.github.io/perlcourse/docs/instructor/notes/</guid><description>You may have a hard time understanding these original notes that I wrote when I was proposing a Perl course to the Cambridge Center for Adult Education. It basically lists what I hoped to include in an 8-week course (one day per week). I’m including it here for completeness, but you probably want to look at the outline and roadmap links.

I never really gave this to anyone since I wasn’t sure that the weeks would work out right, but it’s good for an instructor to see, so they know where to stop each week (assuming you’re teaching it in 8 weeks). Also note that the “Talking to the Operating System” section wasn’t of interest to most students (I usually asked in the beginning of the term) so I rarely taught it.</description></item></channel></rss>
