## Perl Programming Course Materials

I taught Perl programming courses at adult education centers in Boston for a bit and this is a collection of the materials I developed for those courses. (nb: this all happened *ages* ago.) Instructors might be able to adapt these materials for their own courses, prospective Perl programmers might be able to learn a bit about Perl by just browsing these pages, and those of you who already know something about Perl may just want to bookmark a couple of the "Handouts" pages to use as a reference.
