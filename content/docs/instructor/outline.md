title: Outline with Timeline
weight: 4
---

This is the same as the [course outline I’d give to students](/perlcourse/docs/student/outline) except it has the weeks shown. I never really gave this to anyone since I wasn’t sure that the weeks would work out right, but it’s good for an instructor to see, so they know where to stop each week (assuming you’re teaching it in 8 weeks). Also note that the “Talking to the Operating System” section wasn’t of interest to most students (I usually asked in the beginning of the term) so I rarely taught it.
