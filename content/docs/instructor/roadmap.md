Download the [Instructor Roadmap as a Word document](/perlcourse/docs/assets/perl_instructormap.doc). I hate to put a Word document here, but you really need to see it in Outline view. This is Word 6.0/95 format, so it should be fairly easy to open on most computers. Anyway, this is the document that I wrote to guide myself through each day of class. In Word, make sure you choose the “Outline” view.
