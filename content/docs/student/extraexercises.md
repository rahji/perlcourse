If students are really moving along, the [extra exercises](/perlcourse/downloads/perl_extra_exercises.pdf) (42K PDF) have some ideas for more elaborate and practical scripts. Some students continued on with these exercises after the whole workshop ended.

Some of the knowledge required to actually complete these advanced exercises is slightly outside the scope of what’s covered in the rest of the class, but they’re still realistic for a beginner.

* Extra Exercise 1 – Temperature Converter
* Extra Exercise 2 – Playing Cards
* Extra Exercise 3 – Restaurant Waiting List
